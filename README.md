# Coral Identifier

## Overview
Coral Identifier is an innovative mobile application that combines artificial intelligence and environmental data to help users identify and learn about coral species.
Using advanced image recognition technology and real-time environmental data, this app serves as both an identification tool and an educational platform for marine enthusiasts.


## Purpose & Vision
Coral Identifier emerged from real-world experience in coral research and public education. 
As marine researchers, we observed a growing curiosity about coral species during our public outreach programs. 
The recurring question "What is the name of this coral?" inspired us to create a tool that makes coral identification accessible to everyone.

Our vision extends beyond simple identification - we aim to:
- Foster connection between people and marine life
- Provide educational resources about coral ecosystems
- Raise awareness about ocean conservation
- Make marine science accessible to the public
